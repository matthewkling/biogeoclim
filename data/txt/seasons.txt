Seasonal climate phenomena -- the timing of monsoon rains, the temperature of the coldest month, or the heat during the dry season -- are often of greater ecological importance than mean annual climates. Different parts of the country have quite different seasonal cycles, and climate change is often asymmetrical, exhibiting different trends at different times of year. For the selected location, this chart shows seasonal cycles of temperature and precipitation during two time periods. Circular paths link monthly mean climates (01 = January, 02 = February, etc), while light gray arrows show the direction of change between time periods. Selecting *detrend* will remove the difference in annual means between the two time periods, highlighting changes in seasonality alone. The joint display of temperature and precipitation highlights their interacting influence ecological drought stress.
