The terrestrial ecosystems around us can be classified into vegetation communities, each with distinct composition, structure, and function. As climate changes, habitats near your selected location will be exposed to climates that are locally novel. By comparing this local exposure to the range of baseline climates that a habitat is known to inhabit across its full geographic distribution, we can gain insight into the suitability of the new climate for the local habitat. These charts explore the distributions of the most common vegetation types found with the *search radius* area around the selected location. Understanding how these habitats are distributed in geographic space can inform decision-makers about their rarity, while their distributions in climate space (graph in second row) indicate their known climatic tolerance. In this graph, polygons represent the range of climates inhabited by each vegetation type across its full geographic range during a 1948-1980 baseline. The arrow paths show the changing climate of the local populations of each habitat type, starting in the 1948-1980 baseline, and progressing through the 1981-2012 time period and then into the projected 2041-2070 time period -- by comparing these paths with the underlying baseline climate envelopes of each type, you can tell whether the local population is experiencing a new climate that was novel to this type of ecosystem during the baseline. Arrows that exit their respective polygons may indicate higher climatic stress than arrows heading toward the center of their respective climate space; arrows crossing from one polygon into another may indicate that locally, the latter vegetation type will be favored by the new climate.
