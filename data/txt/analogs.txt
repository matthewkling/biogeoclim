Climate analogs can help us grasp the meaning of temperature and precipitation changes, by expressing a location's past or future climate as equivalent to the present climate of a different location. For example, they show us that by 2050, Washington, DC is predicted to have a climate like the 1950s climate of Charlotte, NC, or that the climate zones on Pike's Peak have moved about 200m higher in elevation over the past half century, or that grass seed collected near Tulsa, OK might thrive better near Omaha, NE several decades in the future. This pair of charts shows the location of climates similar to the *reference period* climate of your selected location, with the blue-green-red progression indicating the migration of that climate signature through space. *Zoom* changes the analysis extent. *Specificity* changes the proportion of the map selected as similar to the reference climate. Analysis is currently based on annual mean temperature and annual precipitation.
