Ephemera visualizes the ever-changing relationships between climate, geography, and biotic communities in an era of anthropogenic climate change. This app is a place-based tool aimed at helping users understand dimensions of local climate change by placing that change in the context of geographic climate variation. To get started, type the name of your location (e.g. a town, park, or restoration site) in the box in the upper corner. Temperature and precipitation data across three time periods (1948-1980, 1981-2012, and projected 2041-2070) compare future projected change with trends observed during recent decades of climate change. Climate data are from Climate North America (http://tinyurl.com/ClimateNA), and represent the average projections of 8 global circulation models under the RCP 4.5 emissions scenario. Vegetation data are from LANDFIRE's current extent dataset (http://www.landfire.gov). All data are the result of models and contain uncertainty.
